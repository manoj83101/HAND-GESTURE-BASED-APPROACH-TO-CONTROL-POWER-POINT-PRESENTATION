# HAND-GESTURE-BASED-APPROACH-TO-CONTROL-POWER-POINT-PRESENTATION
Traditional methods of controlling PowerPoint presentations, like using a mouse or 
keyboard, can be limiting and require physical interaction with the device. There is a need for a 
more intuitive and hands-free way to control presentations. 
The problem is to develop a system that allows users to control PowerPoint slides using hand 
gestures. This system should detect hand movements accurately in real-time, even with changes 
in hand position, lighting, and background, to make the presentation process smoother and more 
engaging without needing to touch the screen or use a mouse. 

Aim: 
The primary aim of a hand gesture-based approach for controlling a PowerPoint presentation is to 
provide a more intuitive, interactive, and hands-free way of navigating through slides. This method 
leverages artificial intelligence technology to recognize specific hand movements, enabling the 
presenter to control the presentation seamlessly without the need for a keyboard, mouse, or remote 
control.
